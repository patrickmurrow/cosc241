search method
----------------
if the mid is greater than the left point, use the mid as the new left point

if the mid is less than, use the right point as the new mid

repeat recursively until there are two ints and return the smallest of the two

if the smallest value is already in the middle return mid

if the smallest value's already at the start eg. array[0]<array[array.length-1]
 return 0
