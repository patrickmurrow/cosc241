Plan Lab 07

normalise
-------------------------
have an empty string and if the character is in the alphabet add it to the
empty string, return it in lowercase


isPalindrome
-------------------------
if the first and last characters are equal (using charAt()), call isPalindrome
again with a substring without the first and last characters and repeat until
the string length is less than 2, then return true. If it doesn't reach less
than 2 return false
