Question a)

All the statements before the while loop are O(1) and we can disregard them,
the while loop has complexity of O(n) because nums will always be decremented
by one and unless the cup is empty the while loop will always be entered.
The numbers of cups left are dependent on whether the while loop has emptied
the cup, so if the amount of stones in the cup was smaller than the size of the
list of cups. To remove a cup the complexity is O(1), So the complexity of
emptying a cup will be O(n + c)

Question b)

Complexity is O(N^2 + (n + c)*c), c is multiplied by the amount of times a empty
needs to be called and there is a nested for loop so N has to be squared,
although there are 3 for loops but isn't cubed because of the if statements. So
complexity will be O(N^2 + nc + c^2).
