Lab 11 Plan
-----------------------------

- set h to 1
- for the sequence 1,4,13,40 etc find the highest value under the length of
 the array
- divide h by 3, and set the value at position h to a temporary int
- if position h is smaller than the one before, swap them
- take h of the index and repeat for the next position
- then repeat for different values of h (divide by 3 again)
