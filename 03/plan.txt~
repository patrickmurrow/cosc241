   while (input.hasNextInt()) {
   int num = input.nextInt();
   numbers.add(num); // example of autoboxing
   }

   using hasNextInt() and .nextInt to read the next integer instead of converting the line to an int and then doing the calculations

   don't need try-catch

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

getMax()

   making first int in the array the max and seeing if the next is higher, if is then that int is the new max and so on. max is returned

   will need a for loop
   will need nums.length to stop searching the array
   will need to increment the index which starts at 0
   needs an if statement to see if the indexed int is max

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
   
getMin()

   making first int in the array the min and seeing if the next is lower, if it is then that int is the new min. min is returned

   will need a for loop
   will need .length to stop searching the array
   will need to increment the index which starts at 0
   needs an if statement to see if the indexed int is max
